# Othello-Ai

## Description:
Othello is a two-player strategy game played on a 8x8 board, where each player has pieces that are either black or white. The goal of the game is to have the most pieces of your color on the board at the end of the game.

## Game Rules:
The game's objective is to have more pieces of your color on the board than your opponent at the end of the game. Here are the basic rules of Othello:
   *1 The game starts with four pieces placed in the center of the board, with two pieces of each color placed diagonally.
   *2 Players take turns placing one piece on the board, with their color facing up. The piece must be placed on an empty square adjacent to an opponent's piece so that at least one of the opponent's pieces is flanked by the new piece and another piece of the player's color.
   *3 Any opponent's pieces that are flanked by the new piece and another piece of the player's color are flipped over to become the player's color.
   *4 If a player can't place a piece that flanks an opponent's piece, they must pass their turn.
   *5 The game ends when no more pieces can be placed on the board. The player with the most pieces of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.
   *6 In Othello, it is legal to flip multiple rows or columns of pieces in a single move, as long as they are all flanked by a new piece and another piece of the player's color.
   *7 Players must make a move if they have a legal move available to them. If a player cannot make a legal move, their turn is forfeited.
